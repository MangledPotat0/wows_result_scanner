# THIS REPOSITORY IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

## What is this project?

I am building an overlay tool that allows me to take screenshots of the result
screens in the online video game "World of Warships," perform OCR on the
screenshots, and extract the relevant information from the screenshots and dump
them into a postgres database.

## Why am I doing this?

This project is meant to be a demonstration of my skills building an end-to-end
ETL pipeline starting from raw data collection to data analysis. I chose this
particular game because they provide a lot of stats on the post-match results
screen, and also I like ships.
